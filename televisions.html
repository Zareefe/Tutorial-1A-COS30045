    <h1>Television Energy Consumption</h1>
    <p>
      Modern televisions vary greatly in their power usage depending on size and
      technology. Below is a sample comparison:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>TV Size</th>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Average Power (W)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>32"</td><td>LED</td><td>30W</td></tr>
        <tr><td>55"</td><td>LED</td><td>80W</td></tr>
        <tr><td>65"</td><td>OLED</td><td>120W</td></tr>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            The analysis of Australian television energy data reveals that LED and LCD technologies dominate the market, offering both affordability and efficiency that appeal to most consumers.
            Among all sizes, 55-inch models are the most common, reflecting strong demand for mid-to-large screens.
            Major brands such as Samsung, LG, and Sony provide the widest range of models, giving retailers greater flexibility in stock selection.
            While larger screens generally use more power, several high-star-rated models demonstrate that energy efficiency and size can coexist.
            Overall, these insights help retail buyers make data-driven decisions about which products to stock, balancing consumer demand, energy performance, and sustainability goals.
